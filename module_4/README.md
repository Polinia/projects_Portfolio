## Objectives:
to build a scoring model for the bank's secondary clients that would predict the probability of a client's default. To do this, it will be necessary to determine the significant parameters of the borrower.

## Data Description:

# As a result of the work, the following were achieved:
* ROC AUC - 0.739
* Accuracy score - 0.6744
* F1-score - 0.6759
* MSE - 0.3256
* Recall score - 0.6782
* TP - 8707
* FP - 4278
* FN - 4191
* TN - 8831

## Conclusions:
We carried out a series of a standard manipulations on the selection of training models and the best hyperparameters. This made it possible to obtain decent and stable results in all parts of the sample.
