## The aim of the project:
is to track the impact of the living conditions of the students aged between 15 and 22 on their results in mathematics for identification students that are at the risk at an early stage. 

## Objectives:
- Data processing, EDA
- statistical analysis
- correlation analysis
- make conclusions

My goal was to analyze the data and identify the indicators that could most affect math performance. I learned how to evaluate the results of analyzes and make conclusions. I also practiced data cleaning. I learned that through analysis, you can find the relationship between indicators.

## Data description:

## Conclusions:
- there were enough empty values in the data, which we replaced with more frequent ones (mode)
- were found outliers only in the absences column, and a few errors in 'famrel' and 'fedu'. The data is quite clean.
- based on the results of the correlation analysis, we can conclude that academic performance is affected by: the education of parents, who most likely help the child with studies; child's failures outside of school; spending time with friends are speaking of insufficient time devoted to study.
- according to the results of the analysis, such indicator as 'higher' showed that it has a strong effect on the assessment and, in general, I think, on training. I will also conclude that mothers devote more time to extracurricular education.
- in my opinion, I have identified the most important parameters for building a model such as sex, medu, fedu, mjob, schoolsup, higher, failures, goout, romantic.
