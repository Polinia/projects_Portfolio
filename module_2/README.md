## The aim of the project:
is to track the impact of the living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 on their results in mathematics for identification students that are at the risk at an early stage. 

## Objectives:
- Data processing, EDA
- statistical analysis
- correlation analysis
- make conclusions

My gole was to analyze the data and identify the indicators that could most affect math performance. I learned how to evaluate the results of analyzes and make conclusions. I also practiced data cleaning. I learned that through analysis, you can find the relationship between indicators.
