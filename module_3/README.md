#	Restaurant Rating prediction
## The aim:
to create a model for restaurant rating prediction

## Objectives:
- To create my first model based on machine learning algorithms.
- To take part in a competition on kaggle.
- to understand how to properly process the data for better model performance

## Data Description:

## Conclusion
I used Trip Advisor's data to build a model for expected ratings. The goal was to identify any deviations from this model or any inconsistencies because these needed to be evaluated more closely. Such analyses have the potential to identify errors or fraudulent reviews.
